Unnamed Raspberry Pi Music Player
Written by June Bush

Do whatever the fuck you want with this, and comes with no warranty

This software is built to be lightweight (heh), flexible (HAH), and easily installed (HAHAHAHA!!) and modified by end-users to deploy as a music player on the raspberry pi SBC.

Currently it supports a really shitty command-line windows version as well, but that's just because I'm forced to write this on my Windows PC while slacking off at my job.
